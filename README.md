# Final frontier

Scroll vertical game made as a project for [Reboot Academy](https://www.reboot.academy/) by students Rosana, Zebensuy and Norberto. The game is made using Javascript and CSS, ready to use in a html5 compliant browser and tested in Google Chrome, but is not finished.

Use keyboard arrows to move the player ship, and spacebar to shoot.

Not much more to say, go to [github pages](https://noxlp.github.io/ScrollVerticalGame/) and enjoy!
